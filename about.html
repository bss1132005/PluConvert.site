Step-by-Step Guide to Upload Your New Page
Step 1: Go to Your GitHub Repository

    Go to github.com and log in.

    Find and click on your repository for the website (it might be called plusconvert-site or something similar).

    You should now be on the main code page where you can see your index.html file listed.

Step 2: Start the Upload Process

    Look near the top right of the file list. You will see a green button that says < > Code and next to it, a button that says Add file.

    Click the Add file button.

    From the dropdown menu, select Upload files.

Step 3: Add Your about.html File

    You will see a page that says "Drag files here to add them to your repository".

    Find the about.html file on your computer.

    Drag the about.html file and drop it directly onto that area on the GitHub page.

    Alternatively, you can click choose your files and select about.html from your computer.

    You will see about.html appear in the file box.

Step 4: Save the File to Your Repository

    Scroll down to the bottom of the page. You will see a box titled "Commit changes". This is GitHub's way of saying "Save".

    You can leave the text boxes as they are, or in the first box you can type a simple description like Add about page.

    Click the green Commit changes button.

That's It! What Happens Now?

    You will be taken back to your main repository page. You should now see both index.html and about.html in your file list.

    Wait about 1-2 minutes. GitHub Pages will automatically detect the new file and publish it to your live website.

    To test it, open a new Incognito/Private window and go directly to the new URL:

    https://www.plusconvert.sbs/about.html

It should load perfectly.
Your New Workflow

This is now your simple process for adding any new page:

    Create the file on your computer (e.g., contact.html, terms.html).

    Fill it with the correct content (remembering to copy/paste the <head>, <header>, and <footer> sections).

    Go to GitHub, click Add file -> Upload files, and commit the new file.

    Update any links in your other pages to point to the new .html file.

Use Arrow Up and Arrow Down to select a turn, Enter to jump to it, and Escape to return to the chat.
