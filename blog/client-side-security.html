<h2>🔒 Understanding Client-Side Security — Why PlusConvert Keeps Your Files Safe</h2>

<p>When it comes to online file conversion, <b>security</b> is everything. Every day, millions of users upload personal or business files to online tools without knowing exactly what happens behind the scenes. At <b>PlusConvert</b>, we believe you shouldn’t have to trade privacy for convenience.</p>

<p>That’s why our converter uses a <b>client-side architecture</b> — a design that processes files directly in your browser instead of on remote servers. In this post, we’ll explore how this technology works, why it’s more secure than traditional server-based tools, and what it means for your privacy and peace of mind.</p>

<h3>🧠 What Is Client-Side Processing?</h3>

<p>In simple terms, <b>client-side processing</b> means that all file conversions happen right inside your own browser — on your device — without your files ever being uploaded to a third-party server.</p>

<p>This is made possible thanks to modern web technologies like <b>WebAssembly (WASM)</b> and <b>JavaScript APIs</b>, which allow complex tasks such as image, audio, and document conversion to run locally with incredible speed and accuracy.</p>

<p>When you use PlusConvert, your files never leave your computer. Everything stays private, fast, and fully under your control.</p>
